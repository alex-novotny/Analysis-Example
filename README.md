# Excel Sample
This document was originally made to help my fiance with her excel skills, she knows how to program in a multitude of languages but never learned excel.  
This document contains satirical off brand versions of real life brands and is intended to add humor to an otherwise dry document.
The information in this document is completely made up and is not based on reality.
I used the randbetween function to randomly generate some numbers, the column title will be marked by * to indicate this. 
Hopefully I can upload more documents similar to this one using VBA and macros.Ideas for data to use or generate are greatly welcomed.
